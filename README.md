# Cybersecurity Talent Gap Overview

## Summary

The **cybersecurity talent gap** has become one of the most pressing issues facing organizations today, as the demand for skilled professionals continues to exceed supply. As of **2024**, over **1.5 million job openings** exist within the U.S. cybersecurity sector. However, the available workforce is only about **1.28 million professionals**, leaving a significant shortfall of approximately **225,200 cybersecurity experts**. 

This talent gap is especially noticeable in **mid-level positions**, which typically require **2-10 years of experience**. These roles are essential for companies to strengthen their defenses against the rising threat of cyberattacks. Without qualified professionals in these positions, businesses are more vulnerable to breaches, data theft, and other malicious activities. Additionally, the shortage of talent impedes innovation and slows the growth of cybersecurity technologies and solutions, leaving organizations unable to keep up with rapidly evolving cyber threats.

To address this, it is crucial for the industry to focus on initiatives that can upskill individuals, provide more training opportunities, and bridge the gap by attracting more talent into the cybersecurity workforce. In an effort to support this goal, weâ€™ve created this **Cybersecurity Quiz** designed to help assess and improve your cybersecurity knowledge, targeting **Entry-Level**, **Mid-Level**, and **Senior-Level** professionals.

By identifying knowledge gaps and providing valuable learning experiences, this quiz can help guide individuals toward better understanding and addressing the skills shortage in cybersecurity.
